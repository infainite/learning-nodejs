# NodeJS Getting Started 

From [Official Website](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn)

## Getting Started  

- Open Source Cross Platform JavaScript Runtime Environment
- Runs on V8 JavaScript engine (core of Google Chrome) outside of a browser
- Single Process (Single Threaded), has asynchronous I/O
- Default mode is DEBUG not PRODUCTION
- Supports TypeScript

## Asynchronous Work  

- JavaScript is designed to be non-blocking
- To prevent the "freezing" of code when a process is running for a long time, we can use callbacks but that can lead to callback hell
- This is where functions come into great use. More complex operations are mde up of many functions:
 - Initiator style/input: This function will accept the original input, if any, for the operation and then call the middleware, passing it the input and a callback function
 - Middleware: This function operates on the input according to whatever operation has to be conducted and then calls the terminator while passing it the callback function
 - Terminator: This function marks the end of the operation and invokes the callback function, maybe with the result of the operation
- State Management: A function is called state dependent if any of its input or variable depends on an outside function. There are primary two strategies for state management:
 - Passing in variables directly to a function
 - Acquiring a variable value from a cache, session, file, database , network or other outside source
 - ```NOTE: Using global variables for state management is not suggested since it makes it hard or sometimes impossible to gaurantee state```
- Control Flow: You will be able to perform almost all of your operations with the following three patterns:
 - In Series: Functions are executed in a strict sequential order, this one is most similar to a simple for loop
 - Full Parallel: When ordering is not an issue
 - Limited Parallel: Parallel with limit
- NodeJS uses event loop method instead of multiple threads to handle concurrent work
- Prevent mixing synchronous and asynchronous code
- NodeJS uses the `error-first callbacks`, i.e., the first parameter in all callback functions is the error object, which is null if there is no error
- Every time the NodeJS event loop takes a full trip, it is caled a `tick`. `process.nextTick()` takes a function as an argument which is invoked before the next tick starts
- Understanding NodeJS Execution Order
 - `process.nextTick()` adds a function to the `process.nextTick queue`
 - `Promise.then()` adds a function to `promise microtask queue`
 - `setTimeout` or `setImmediate` adds a function to `microtask queue`
 - NodeJS event loop first executes `process.nextTick queue` then `promise mircotask queue` and then finally `microtask queue`
- The NodeJS `events` module provides the `EvenEmitter` class which can be used to handle events
